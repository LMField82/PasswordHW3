Password Generator

1. Installation
No installation required

2. Usage
This application is used for generating a random password. The user is first prompted to select the length of the password from a range of numbers. The user is then asked to include at least one of the following character types: special characters, numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. A password is generated using the criteria selected by the user. The user can then copy the password to the clipboard. 

3. Credits
TA Krystal helped me to flatten my array of arrays to a single array. I received help from Natatlia in order to write some psuedocode My tutor, Chad Tao, helped me understand how to actually copy the password to the clipboard and he helped me understand the syntax used with the DOM.
